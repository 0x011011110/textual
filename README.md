Textual adds interactivity to [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) with an API inspired by modern web development.

Textual apps can use **16.7 million** colors with mouse support and smooth flicker-free animation.

A powerful layout engine, theming system, and re-usable [widgets](https://textual.textualize.io/widget_gallery/) makes it possible to build apps that rival the desktop and web experience.

Great [documentation](https://textual.textualize.io/) and a [builtin testing framework](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/testing/) means that Textual apps can be maintained idefinitely.
