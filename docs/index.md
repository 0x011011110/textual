# Welcome

Welcome to the [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) framework documentation. Built with ❤️ by [Textualize.io](https://www.textualize.io)

<hr>

Textual is a Python framework for building applications that run within your terminal.

Text User Interfaces (TUIs) have a number of benefits:

- **Quick to develop:** Really rapid app development with a modern Python API.
- **Low requirements:** Textual apps anywhere with a Python interpreter, even single-board computers.
- **Cross platform:** The same code will run on Linux, Windows, MacOS and more.
- **Remote:** Fully featured UIs can run over SSH.
- **CLI integration:** Textual apps integrate with your shell and other CLI tools.

Textual TUIs are quick and easy to build with pure Python (not to mention _fun_).
