## Installation

You can install Textual via PyPi.

If you plan on developing Textual apps, then you can install `textual[dev]`. The `[dev]` part installs a few extra dependencies for development.

```bash
pip install textual[dev]
```

If you only plan on _running_ Textual apps, then you can drop the `[dev]` part:

```bash
pip install textual
```

## Textual CLI app

If you installed the dev dependencies, you have have access to the `textual` CLI command. There are a number of sub-commands which will aid you in building Textual apps. See the help for more details:

```bash
textual --help
```
